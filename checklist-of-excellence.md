### My random list

If you can check everything on this list, congratulations, you are doing excellent!

- [ ] **Do you have a documentation which tells exactly what your product is?**

    You will explain the project to new members anyways, just document what you tell them.

- [ ] **Are you proud of your codebase?**
- [ ] **Are your co-workers proud of the codebase?**
- [ ] **Have you tried to install your product?**
- [ ] **Have you tried to use your own product for a week?**
- [ ] **Do you have a *start here* documentation for new project members?**
- [ ] **Is your *start here* documentation so good that you don't need to explain it further?**
- [ ] **Can you refactor your code without fearing that your app won't work?**
- [ ] **Do you have strict conventions about project style(tab/space, indent, naming)**

    If you don't eventually your code will be a mess of different styles:
    
    * Diffs will be polluted by mix of spaces and tabs
    * Code is hard to read

- [ ] **Do you know how outdated your project's dependencies are?**

    You should have a single meter like: 6/10 of dependencies are outdated

- [ ] **Would you be and others in your team comfortable to show code to other team members for reviews?**

    If not, you should discuss about the reasons with your team.

#### Web development related

- [ ] **Do you version your product?**

    If you don't have a version, you'll eventually be confused what version is deployed to staging/test/prod.

- [ ] **Do you have deployment scripts in version control?**
- [ ] **Do you know how outdated your hosting servers are?**
- [ ] **Can you easily replicate testing/staging/production environment locally for testing?**
